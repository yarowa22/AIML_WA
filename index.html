index.html — Your Homepage
================================================================================

This is the main page of your site. Everything below follows a pattern you'll
see in most web pages: a DOCTYPE, then an html element containing head and body.

The comments throughout this file explain what things are called and roughly
what they do. You don't need to read every comment before starting—skim them
when you're curious, or when you're trying to find something specific.

Feel free to experiment. If you break something, you can always look at the
original or fork the repository again.

<html lang="en">
<!--
The <html> element wraps everything. The lang="en" attribute tells browsers
and screen readers that the content is in English.
-->

<head>
    <!--
    The <head> contains information ABOUT the page—metadata that doesn't appear
    on the page itself but affects how it displays and how search engines see it.
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
    Character encoding. UTF-8 supports virtually all characters from all
    languages. Always include this first.
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
    This makes the page work properly on mobile devices. Without it, phones
    would display your site as a tiny zoomed-out desktop page.
    -->

    <meta name="description" content="A personal portfolio website">
    <!--
    Search engines might display this in search results. Update it to describe
    your site.
    -->

    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <!--
    This appears in the browser tab. It's also what shows in search results
    and bookmarks. Update it to reflect your site.
    
    → Exercise 3: Change this to your name or site name
    -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <!--
    This connects your HTML to the CSS file. Without this link, none of your
    styles would apply.
    -->

    <!-- Exercise 25: Add your favicon link here when you're ready
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
    -->
</head>

<body>
    <!--
    Everything visible on the page goes in the <body>. The structure here uses
    semantic elements: <header>, <main>, <footer> instead of generic <div>s.
    These communicate meaning to screen readers and search engines.
    -->

    <header>
        <!--
        The site header typically contains the logo/site name and main navigation.
        This appears at the top of every page.
        
        → Exercise 20: The CSS makes this "sticky"—scroll down your page and
          notice how the header stays visible at the top.
        -->
        <div class="container header-content">
            <!--
            The "container" class centers content and limits its width.
            Look at .container in styles.css to see how it works.
            -->

            <a href="index.html" class="logo">My Portfolio</a>
            <!--
            The logo is just a styled link that points back to the homepage.
            Update the text to match your site name.
            -->

            <nav class="main-nav">
                <!--
                The <nav> element indicates this is navigation. Screen readers
                recognize it and can announce "navigation" to users.

        </div>
    </header>

    <main>
        <!--
        The <main> element contains the primary content of the page.
        There should be only one <main> per page.
        -->

        <section class="hero">
            <!--
            The "hero" is the large prominent section at the top of many sites.
            It typically contains a headline and brief introduction.

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
                <!--
                Every page should have one <h1>—the main heading.
                Screen readers and search engines use headings to understand
                the page structure.

                <!--
                This looks like a button but is actually a link. The difference:
                <button> is for actions (like submitting a form).
                <a> is for navigation (going somewhere).
                This navigates to the about page, so it's a link styled as a button.

        <section class="section about-preview">

            A preview of the about page content. Notice the class "section"—

                    The "card" class creates a contained box with background,
                    padding, and shadow. You'll see this pattern throughout.
